# Data structure problems and exercises. 

This repository contain detailed concepts for Graphs and trees. There are some coding problems which were solved in an optimal way to get better  time and space complexity.These would help in faster data processing and better memory management,


The repository provides implementations for 
## Project Structure

- `DSA basics/` LRU cache, trees, sorting and searching algorithms.

- `LinkedList/` Linked list problems such as reversing linked list, mergining multiple LL.
  
- `Recursion/` Recursion and backtracking.
  
- `Trees/` Problems to understand binary tree.
  
- `backup/` Some scripts which I wrote in jupyterhub which has some of the coding problems and concepts.

- `Coding Problems/` All the problems which were solved by mee from leetcode.

- `Machine Learning/` Some concepts about machine learning such as regression, classification, clustering algorithms and accuracy estimation of each model. 



## Python Compatibility
The content in this collection supports Python 3.6 and higher 

## Installation 

- Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Python-Graph-MachineLearning.git
```

- You might need Anaconda navigator for some of the scripts.  
  Installing Navigator  
  Navigator is automatically installed when you install Anaconda Distribution version 4.0.0 or higher.

> If you have Miniconda or a version of Anaconda Distribution older than 4.0.0 installed, install Navigator from Anaconda Prompt, Terminal, or other command line interface by running the command `conda install anaconda-navigator`.

For more information on using Navigator, see https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html
